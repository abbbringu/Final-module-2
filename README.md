## Description
This is a small app with pre-written data formatted as a json file. The data is parsed and 
displayed in small cards with text. Upon clicking one of the cards, the user will be redirected to a more 
detailed page with more information. 

This was part of a tutorial, where an image of how the desired project would look like. And the implementation was left in 
my arms. While I didn't design the app, I ded devlop it. 

## What I learned:
* MVVM structure
* Json structure and parsing
* Data flow
* Navigation view and links
* Variable one way binding
* Multiple views
